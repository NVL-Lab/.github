# Welcome to the NVL lab! 👋👋

At nvl, we are not just a mere pointer, but rather an enigmatic force pointing to the unknown (*). 
<br />
<br />
Here you'll find the repositories for the NVL lab. The lab will open its doors on Jan 2nd, so that's why it is half empty... for now!
<br />
<br />
Let's get started!

<sub>(*) I've been told the joke may be lost in many that don't get the similarity between nvl and null. To know more about null pointers follow this [link](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) </sub>
